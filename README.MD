# Welcome to PythonBowl
## Introduction
Hello, and welcome to PythonBowl, this is a remake of Retro Bowl in Python and terminal-wise, I hope you enjoy this game and I hope you can make this a fun game by contributing and giving ideas and reporting bugs. Thank you. -Lufthansaaa

## Rules
The rules are very simple, the first to 35 wins, all features are available like kickoff, kick return, defense, and offense. You can also punt, field goal, and return a punt, fumbles and interceptions are also included.

## How to play
The controls are really easy, it usually tells you how to play and the scoreboard will show once in a while, you just click a letter and press enter (REMEMBER TO PRESS ENTER) and you will be able to do the play.

## Last words
Thank you so much for reading this far and if you made it this far, here is a tip, always do a passing play when you are in a tight situation when you are sacked, or need game-winning score.
